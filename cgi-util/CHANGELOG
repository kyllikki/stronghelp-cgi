2.0.4  - 1999.August.24 - The "unescape_url" code was too trusting.
                          MJ Pomraning (pilcrow@mailbag.com)

2.0.3  - 1999.August.13 - Some debugging code was left in 2.0.2.  It has been
                          removed.
                          Stan Osborne (stan@ana.com)

2.0.2  - 1999.August.9 - If a POST-method submittion contained an "&" within
                         one of the field's values, the value would be
                         truncated.  This should be fixed.

                       - CGIUTILVER (defined in "cgi-util.h") now
                         reports complete version number (2.0.2).
